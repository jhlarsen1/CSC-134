#include <iostream>
/*
The line #include <iostream> in C++ is a preprocessor directive that tells 
the compiler to include the standard input/output stream library in your program.
The iostream library provides functionalities for input and output operations, such as 
printing to the screen and reading from the keyboard. Specifically, it allows you to use 
objects like std::cout for output and std::cin for input.
*/

using namespace std;
/*
The line using namespace std; in C++ is a directive that allows you to avoid having to 
prefix standard library components (like std::cout, std::cin, std::string, etc.) with std::.
In C++, the Standard Library functions, objects, and classes are part of the std namespace. 
By using the directive using namespace std;, you're telling the compiler that you want to use 
all the components in the std namespace directly without needing to specify std:: each time.
